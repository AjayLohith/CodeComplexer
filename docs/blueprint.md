# **App Name**: CodeSight

## Core Features:

- Code Editor: Code Editor Interface similar to VSCode, to facilitate code writing.
- Real-time Error Detection: Displays syntax errors in real-time as the user is coding, directly within the editor.
- Complexity Estimation: Estimates the time and space complexity of the code. Analyzes the code's efficiency, and then displays its time and space complexity.
- Fix Suggestions & Best Practices: Suggests fixes and code improvements, to help improve code quality.
- Syntax Highlighting: Highlight code syntax according to the chosen programming language.
- Language Selection: Allows selecting a programming language from a pre-defined list. Supported languages: Python, JavaScript, C++, Java.
- Best Practice Analysis: The app uses an LLM as a tool to identify ways to re-factor user code to follow common coding best practices.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark indigo (#4B0082) to convey intellect and attention to detail.
- Background color: Very dark grayish-blue (#292F33). Use of a dark theme enhances the coding environment, reducing eye strain.
- Accent color: Deep purple (#6A3EA1) for interactive elements.
- Use monospace font for code display, enhancing readability.
- Split-screen layout: Editor on the left, results/feedback on the right.
- Use simple icons for common actions (run, stop, save) with clear tooltips.
- Subtle transition animations when code is executed and results are displayed.
